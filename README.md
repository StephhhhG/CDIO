# CAMF BETA

This document presents the disinfection capsule for banana field boots and tools called CAMF BETA. 
The project was designed to solve the problem that has caused millions of dollars in losses in banana farms, as they are exposed to be affected by Fusarium RT4, a bacterium that attacks plants, withers their leaves and generates 
affected by Fusarium RT4 bacteria that attacks the plants, withers their leaves, causes plant death and renders the soil infertile for decades. 
for decades.
Since this bacterium is spread by contact of any infected object with the field, this user-friendly capsule was designed,
with an irrigation system of quaternary ammonium and water under concentrations regulated by the ICA, 10 ml of ammonium for every 990 ml of water.
The system manages a storage system for the registration of user data, as well as the registration of the use of the machine to know if the people who are accessing the field are using the machine.
the machine to know if the people who are accessing the field are performing the previous disinfection.
For the user's convenience, the system is semi-automatic, the user only has to register his data and/or facial registration and enter the tools to be disinfected in the disinfecting machine.
the tools to be disinfected in the capsule, after which the system sprays the chemical for 10 seconds to certify a 97% disinfection.
certify a disinfection of 97% regulation given by the ICA in Resolution No.2398 of 2011, then the tools are ready to be used.

In this repository you can find the programming codes for the operation of the system and the code designed for the registration and facial recognition of the user.

1.For the activation stage, there is a recognition system where users who are going to access the field register their personal and biometric data only once, thus making it easier to use the capsule each time they are going to use it and only their face must be scanned by the camera to activate the facial recognition of the system.

2.In the disinfectant spraying stage, the user must put his boots and tools into the capsule to activate the sprinklers that release the mixture of water and quaternary ammonium in concentrations of 10 ml for every 990 ml of water for 10 seconds, the user is informed on the screen when to remove his boots and tools.
and tools.

3.At the process completion stage the waste will exit the capsule through one of the hoses at the rear of the machine and is stored in a waste container.

4.At the machine status stage, a report of the stored data of the people using the capsule with their date is kept to verify that all users are disinfecting their implements before entering the field.
